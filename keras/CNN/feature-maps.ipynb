    "<p>In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a <b>feature map</b> (also often called an <b>activation map</b>) is the output of a convolutional layer.</p>\n",

    "    <li><b>Input to a CNN:</b> When you feed an image into a CNN, it's typically a multi-channel tensor (e.g., for a color image, it might be height x width x 3 for Red, Green, and Blue channels).</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Convolutional Layer:</b> The core operation in a convolutional layer is <b>convolution</b>. This involves sliding a small matrix called a <b>filter</b> (or kernel) over the input image or a feature map from a previous layer.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Generation Process:</b>\n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "            <li>[Convolution strides]: The filter operates by sliding a window (e.g., 2x2) over the input feature map and, within each window, it performs element-wise multiplication with the small patch of the input it's currently overlapping. All these products are then summed up to produce a single value in the output feature map in 2D array</li>\n",
    "            <li>[Max-pooling]: Max pooling operates by sliding a window (e.g., 2x2) over the input feature map and, within each window, it selects the maximum value.\n",
    "            </li>\n",
    "            <li>This process is repeated as the filter slides across the entire input, generating a 2D matrix of values. This 2D matrix is one feature map.</li>\n",
    "        </ul>\n",

    "<h3>What a Feature Map Represents</h3>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Specific Features:</b> Each filter in a convolutional layer is designed (or, more accurately, <i>learned</i> during training) to detect a specific kind of pattern or \"feature\" in the input. For example, one filter might become specialized in detecting horizontal edges, another for vertical edges, another for corners, and so on.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Spatial Presence:</b> The values within a feature map indicate the <i>strength</i> of the detected feature at different spatial locations in the input. A high value at a particular pixel in the feature map means that the corresponding feature was strongly present at that location in the original input.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Learned Representations:</b> As data flows through deeper layers of a CNN, the feature maps become increasingly abstract. Early layers might capture low-level features like edges and textures. Deeper layers combine these simpler features to detect more complex patterns, such as object parts (e.g., a wheel, an eye) or even entire objects.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>A single convolutional layer typically employs <b>multiple filters</b> (e.g., 32, 64, 128 filters). Each filter produces its own distinct feature map. Therefore, the output of a convolutional layer is a \"stack\" of these 2D feature maps, representing a comprehensive set of features extracted from the input at that particular stage of the network.</p>\n",
    "<p>In essence, feature maps are the intermediate, transformed representations of the input data that a CNN learns. They are crucial because they enable the network to automatically extract hierarchical and meaningful features from raw data, which is a key reason for the success of CNNs in tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</p>"
